    <h1>Welcome to MirrorKat.com</h1>
    <p>
      Do you enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror? Singing in the shower? Watching Meerkats?
      Farting in your air tight and fashionable SpaceX space suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      You're in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, Meerkat is the nerdiest topic since Roko's Basilisk.
    </p>
    <p>This is just the sample home page - work is obviously still in progress.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>WTH is MirrorKat</h2>
    <p>
      MirrorKat is a casual effort at providing a catalyst for a global community of Meerkat contributors who make an on going
      and deliberate effort to keep Meerkat a positive, safe, and entertaining experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meerkat is an awesome use of technology with the absolute capacity for changing how the world community engages in
      conversation. It is, unfortunately, also the perfect medium for the very worst characteristics of the social internet.
      Among these concerns are child pornography, cyber bullying, pile ons, and demagoguery. (I'm sure there's a ton more).
    </p>
    <p>
      The internet is a big place. If every iPhone user in the world started streaming from a different place at the
      same time, it's quite plausible that you could see any place in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably a subculture of MetaKats will probably emerge to to address these same issues, but for now
      MirrorKat is providing two specific services.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organizing fun, inclusive, and positive opportunities for parties to collaborate via Meerkat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide reputation management and abuse reporting.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>MirrorKat Parties</h2>
    <p>As part of our effort to create benevolent Meerkat interactions we are organizing a number of activities for the
    community. Our first event is scheduled for Wednesday March 25th, 2015 at 6:30 PM PDT. We have several ideas that
    we will test throughout the end of April. Based on the results we will start / stop / continue different activities
    going forward.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Meerkat Charades Tournament March 25th, 2015 6:30 PM PDT (unix timestamp: 1427333400)</h3>
      <p>Teams of four compete at increasingly difficult charades elimination tournament.</p>
      <p>Teams can register here. Official rules are here.</p>
    </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Reputation management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>Report abusive, illicit, and other base behaviors here. All reported incidents are disclosed in the MirrorKat
          blotter. For currently running streams that are grossly illegal or in violation of Meerkat's ToS you can provide
          your twitter handle with your report and we will immediately message Meerkat and Twitter to request an immediate take down.
          You may also report a stream anonymously and MirrorKat will reach out to a select group of individuals to connect
          to the allegedly offensive stream to make an effort to validate your report.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <p>Read the blotter.</p>
